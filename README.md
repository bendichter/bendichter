### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the Founder of [CatalystNeuro](catalystneuro.com), a consulting and software development company that facilitates collaboration in neuroscience. I have been fortunate enough to find a team of like-minded neuroscientists and software developers, and together we are finding ways to contribute to the field outside of the standard academic path. 

Check out [My personal website](bendichter.com) for more information.
